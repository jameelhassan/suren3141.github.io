	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic, within a short time span, has had a significant impact on every aspect of life in almost every country on the planet. As it evolved from a local epidemic isolated to certain regions of China, to the deadliest pandemic since the influenza outbreak of 1918, scientists all over the world have only amplified their efforts to combat it. In that battle, Artificial Intelligence, or AI, with its wide ranging capabilities and versatility, has played a vital role and thus has had a sizable impact. In this review, we present a comprehensive analysis of the use of AI techniques for spatio-temporal modeling and forecasting and impact modeling on diverse populations as it relates to COVID-19. Furthermore, we catalogue the articles in these areas based on spatio-temporal modeling, intrinsic parameters, extrinsic parameters, dynamic parameters and multivariate inputs (to ascertain the penetration of AI usage in each sub area). The manner in which AI is used and the associated techniques utilized vary for each body of work. Majority of articles use deep learning models, compartment models, stochastic methods and numerous statistical methods. We conclude by listing potential paths of research for which AI based techniques can be used for greater impact in tackling the pandemic.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work is funded by IDRCAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:This work is funded by COVID-19 Global South Artificial Intelligence and Data Innovation Program of the International Development Research Centre (IDRC), CanadaAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.
